P6
246 = 6*41 = 6*(5^2+4^2) = 6*(5-4i)(5+4i)

P7
kernel = (9(x+1)^2 - 2)
Let I = (9(x+1)^2 - 2) = (f)
Clearly, I \subset kernel.
Now any g \in kernel = by long division with f will have remainder of the form ax + b. Now by evaluation at \sqrt(2)/3 - 1. This will be zero iff a = b = 0. So, g \in I = (f).
