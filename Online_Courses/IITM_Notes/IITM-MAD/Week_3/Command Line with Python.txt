Command Line Manipulation with Python

# To execute a python file on cmd:
% python <path_to_file>.py

# To take arguments from command line:
% python <path_to_file>.py arg1 arg2 arg3

Inside python, the list 'sys.argv' holds all the arguments as type 'str'.
python code:
```
import sys
arg_list = sys.argv
# arg_list = ['py_file_name.py', 'arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3']
```


# To use the 'main' function inside python file only, if called on command line. Example:

python code:
```
def main():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # execute only if run as a script
    main()
```

Now if we call the python file in cmd, it will only execute whatever's inside the main function.
